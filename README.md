# GlueETLUsingStepFunction

In a modern data pipeline, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes often require multiple stagesâ€”such as data extraction from multiple sources, transformation with business logic, and loading into data warehouses or data lakes. AWS Glue is a fully managed ETL service, while AWS Step Functions helps orchestrate and coordinate multiple Glue jobs and other AWS services to build a complete and automated pipeline.
